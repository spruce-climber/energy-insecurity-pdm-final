An exploration of RECS energy insecurity data in the DMV. This repo contains the public microdata .xlsx for the 2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, the codebook/data dictionary, the Quarto file containing all scripts and code chunks, and the finished .html report. Please note that due to the size of the RECS file, it is a compressed zip file. You will have to unzip and download in order to successfully read in RECS data.
